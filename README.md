# FruitControl

A frontend iTunes alternative to Linux.

## What exactly is FruitControl?

FruitControl is an iTunes-like frontend for Linux (only) made with Godot, with a backend based on libimobiledevice.

FruitControl's goal is it to provide a native GUI for iPhone/iPad owners to control their devices from their Linux machines.
Restoring, upgrading, general information extraction is already possible. More features are planned in the future.

Note: This app will only reliably work on Arch Linux or other rolling-release distros as it will use the newest features of the backend provided by libimobiledevice
